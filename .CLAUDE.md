- Tasks
  - Common development tasks are stored in taskfile.yml
  - Run `task` to list them
  - Some tasks include:
    - Running integration tests
    - Generating snapshots and regression tests
    - Installing tractor globally

- Development Tips
  - Use XML passthrough (`-l xml`) to test XPath queries against specific XML structures:
    ```bash
    # Test if a query works on a given XML structure
    echo '<type><generic/>Dictionary<arguments>&lt;string&gt;</arguments></type>' \
      | tractor -l xml -x "//type[.='Dictionary<string>']" -o value
    ```
  - This is useful for debugging XPath queries and understanding string-value matching
  - Use `--no-pretty` to see the compact XML that XPath actually queries against
