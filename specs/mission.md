# Mission

<!-- TODO: one-liner mission statement. Candidates so far:
  - "Learn it once. Apply it forever."
  - "Every lesson your team learns should become a rule your codebase follows."
  - "Stop re-learning the same lessons. Start embedding them."
  - "Make team knowledge permanent."
  - "Your codebase should remember what your team knows."
  None of these landed yet. Looking for something punchy, natural,
  not cringy. A sales director should accept it.
-->

Give development teams the power to turn their hard-won lessons into
living rules that guide the entire codebase.

Every team accumulates wisdom: patterns that work, insights from
incidents, conventions that keep code maintainable. But knowledge that
isn't embedded in the codebase fades, and teams find themselves
re-learning the same lessons.

What if conventions could be expressed as programmable rules - so
standards are upheld automatically, and developers get immediate
feedback when something drifts?

Tractor's aspiration is to make all coding conventions executable.
Where that's not yet possible, clear documentation with examples
bridges the gap.

This mission is intended to remain stable for 10-20+ years.

## Notes

- The desired outcome is NOT that things are documented or shared.
  The outcome is that lessons are applied and all code follows them.
- Executable/programmable code conventions is the core, not a nice-to-have.
  Documentation is a fallback.
- Documentation and spoken agreements are weak enforcers.
- Tone should be soft/harmonious/teamsy, not aggressive. Avoid:
  "enforcer", "violation", "vigilance", "painful", "mistakes".
  Prefer: "guide", "upheld", "drifts", "immediate feedback", "lessons".
